<br><br><div id="helptext" style="visibility: hidden;">Program made to help you find bats in the thieving room at raids
<br><br>How to use: search random chests in the thieving room until you find a poison chest
<br>Select the corresponding chest in the map
<br>If done correctly, red circles should appear around certain other chests in the map
<br>These circles indicate that there might be bats or poison in these chests
<br>Once you have searched a chest with a red circle that has poison in it, select that chest in the map again
<br>Repeat this process until you have found the chest containing bats
<br><i>note: not all data has been gathered yet so it might not always be able to predict the chests</i>
